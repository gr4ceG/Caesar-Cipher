# Caesar Cipher
This program deciphers and encodes text using the Caesar substitution cipher. 

Ceaser Cipher takes in a message from input and provides options to perform three functions: 
1. Encodes the message with a provided shift interval. 
2. Decodes the message with a provided shift interval. 
3. Decodes the message with Brute Force: displays all (26) possible messages and selects the most probable message based on an analysis of word semblance to real english words.
